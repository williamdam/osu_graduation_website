            This past year has been a test of courage, determination, and the human spirit.  All of us have been affected
            by the global pandemic and many have suffered loss.  Around the world, lives have been changed, forever. 
            Yet, in the face of adversity, under diminishing odds, and surrounded by uncertainty, there are those who refused
            to give up.  So, we celebrate these victories and triumphs, for they are the light, in a time of darkness.  
            <strong>Congratulations to the class of 2021!</strong>

        <p>
          There are various services available to broadcast live video.  In this example, I've embedded a Youtube Live player 
          with a pre-scheduled broadcast time, to coincide with this interview.  Although canceling an on-campus commencement ceremony
          is a disappointment to many, a virtual format would allow more students and guests to attend.  This is especially true 
          for Ecampus students, as many are located in other countries.
